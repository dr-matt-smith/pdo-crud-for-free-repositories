# Changelog

All Notable changes to `pdo-crud-for-free-repositories` will be documented in this file.

Updates should follow the [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) principles.

## NEXT - 2017

- split DatabaseTableRepository actions into 2

    - read only actions like getAll() and getOneById()

    - change actions like create(), update() and delete()

    - this would make it safer to use on DB views as well as actual tables
